System Requirements
-------------------

The following Perl version and packages are required for running
postfix-policyd-spf-perl:

  Perl 5.6
  version
  NetAddr-IP 4
  Mail::SPF (not Mail-SPF-Query) version 2.006 or later
  Sys::Hostname::Long

Installing
----------

 1. Copy postfix-policyd-spf-perl to /usr/local/lib/policyd-spf-perl

 2. Add the following to /etc/postfix/master.cf:

        policy  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
            user=nobody argv=/usr/local/lib/policyd-spf-perl

 3. Configure the Postfix policy service in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            ...
            reject_unauth_destination
            check_policy_service unix:private/policy
            ...

    NOTES:  
        Specify check_policy_service AFTER reject_unauth_destination or
        else your system can become an open relay.

        The user 'nobody' is used in this example. This is appropriate if you
        do not have any other services running as nobody. If you do, create a
        dedicated user for this service and use it instead.

 4. Add "policy_time_limit = 3600" to main.cf

 5. Restart Postfix.
