# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)
#   ! = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug, or made a minor improvement

--- 2.010 2012-06-17
    * Fixed incorrect use of != instead of ne for string comparison
      (LP: #1014243)
    ! Changed non-standard X-Comment header fields for localhost and
      whitelisted addresses to use RFC 5451 Authentication Results header
      fields
    ! Added depenency on Sys::Hostname::Long for local hostname determination

--- 2.009 2012-02-03
  * Chomp erroneus NULLs off the end of local and authority explanations to
    work around a Mail::SPF bug (in Mail::SPF versions prior to 2.008)
    (LP: #806926)
    - Patch thanks to Allison Randal
  * Stop logging queue ID since it is virtually never available and clutters
    the logs
  * Reduced non-verbose logging to a single line per message

--- 2.008 (2012-01-19 13:46 -0500)
  ! Query only TXT and not DNS RR Type SPF records to reduce unnecessary DNS
    lookups (LP: #161133)
  * Changed default_authority_explanation ('Why' reject text) to point to
    openspf.net instead of openspf.org due to extended outage
  * Fix incorrect version string
  * Ensure all variables are initialized prior to being passed to syslog

--- 2.007 (2008-07-25 22:24 -0400)
  * Update documentation and examples, see Debian bugs 492420 and 492421 for
    details.

--- 2.006 (2008-07-18 00:49 -0400)
  * Add default logging to make it easier to determine what SPF identity is
    being used

--- 2.005 (2007-12-14 23:29 -0500)
  * Decreased timeout for DNS queries via UDP to 10s from Net::DNS::Resolver's
    default of 40s (by doing only 1 retransmission rather than 3 after a query
    fails).  Until Mail::SPF provides an explicit option for this, we just
    create our own resolver object and make Mail::SPF use that.
  * Adjust master.cf recommendations in INSTALL for new recommendations from
    Wietse Venema (postfix-users mailing list).
  * Other minor documentation cleanup

--- 2.004 (2007-04-18 15:36)
  * Fix header text to work with Postfix (access 5 requirements).

--- 2.003 (2007-04-17 08:50)
  * Minor documentation cleanup.
  + Add handler for list of relay addresses to bypass.

--- 2.002 (2007-02-20 05:45)
  * Added Julian Mehnle to copyright statement.
  * Implemented results cache in order to prevent redundant SPF checks in
    multiple invocations per message instance.  This also enables us to prepend
    a "Received-SPF" header only once per message instance (as opposed to once
    per recipient address).
  * Minor code and comments clean-up.

--- 2.001 (2007-02-08 00:36)
  * Safer check for local connections.

--- 2.000 (2007-02-07 17:07)
  * Change reject reply to 550 for RFC 2821 compliance.
  * Skip SPF checks for local (127.) connections
  * Clarified wording for some verbose logging.
  * Added more information about HELO checking to README.

--- 1.990 (2007-02-03 16:00)

  postfix-policyd-spf-perl:
  ! Changed from Mail::SPF::Query to Mail::SPF for RFC 4408 compliance
  ! Removed Testing handler (usage was undocumented).
  ! Removed debian/ dir from release tarball (still provided via SVN).
  * Simplified logging. Policy server is less chatty.  Logs are clearer.

--- 1.08.1 (2007-01-10 21:00)

  postfix-policyd-spf-perl:
  * Minor and purely cosmetic code clean-up.

  Miscellaneous:
  * Updated README file with new website URL and copyright.
  * Added LICENSE file as an explicit copy of the GPLv2.

  Debian:
  * New maintainer: Scott Kitterman <scott@kitterman.com>
  * Priority: extra (was: optional)
  * Removed Build-Depends-Indep: perl, as there really is no need for it.
  * Depends: libversion-perl
  * Updated debian/copyright.

--- 1.08 (2006-06-17 20:00)

  * Added Debian package control files.
